The way that they transform complex ideas into engaging and visually appealing products really is awesome!They are looking for someone that has strong TypeScript experience – although the product is very front-end focused, they operate in a very strong engineering environment and look for people that have worked in heavy engineering environments. The role would suit someone that comes from a Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics or any other strong technical background as the stuff they are working on is pretty complex. This may also suit Engineers that are passionate about / have experience in 2D & 3D technologies as this a major part of the role.The rest of the tech they work with includes React, WebGL, GLSL and much more.For this particular team, they expect people to be very accomplished problem solvers. As mentioned, the company work on very complex problems, most of which have never been tackled before so it takes a certain type of mind to tackle these. The team are working on a lot of re-architecture at the moment which you’ll be heavily involved in. I’ve had the luxury of seeing demos of their products and they are so engaging.As well as being a good problem solver, this would suit someone that is used to having high levels of autonomy and accountability. They also love people that aren’t afraid to put their own ideas forward.As mentioned, they’re based in Edinburgh City Centre and expect people to be in the office 3 days per week as a minimum. This is non-negotiable as they find 3 days in the office is highly beneficial due to the nature of the products they’re building – they’re a super collaborative as a team and expect any newcomers to buy into this. The salary on offer for the role is up to £70,000 with potential to go above this for the right person.If you have a genuine passion for creating unique product, then please apply and/or get in touch with Jack Steven at Cathcart Technology.
