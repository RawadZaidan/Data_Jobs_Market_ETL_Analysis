What does an Engineer do here?Engineers are at the core of what we do at Mission Labs. As well as making some killer React apps, our clients also count on us for our backend chops - so whatever your forte is, we'd love to chat! Whether that’s using Kinesis streams, lambdas & elastic search clusters to build data pipelines that process and store data from tens of thousands of live calls every day; or harnessing the power of Serverless, API-Gateway and Lambda to build lightning-fast, scalable APIs to power our front-end apps, we’re the team that delivers the core functionality that users love, rely on & use on the daily. We’re an AWS Advanced Consulting Partner and leverage a tonne of services from the AWS ecosystem. Some say we’re bezzies with Bezos - but we don’t like to brag… Ultimately, we just think servers suck and prefer to deploy huge chunks of cloud infra in minutes not months - HBU?

When COVID-19 first crippled the nation, we built an intelligent IVR that helped Sainsbury’s identify, prioritize & assist their most vulnerable customers. Since then, we’ve implemented cloud solutions across the public sector; from enabling people to organise their council tax, and access emergency government funding, to helping people travelling by train plan their journeys more accurately with rescheduled timetables, E-tickets and intelligent seat reservations. Helping people is a big part of what we do - and we like that.What experience do we need to see from you?Daily development with either React, TypeScript or JavaScriptA passion for building highly testable, effective and maintainable systemsStrong application and API development experience with Node.jsExperience with AWS Services - ideally Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoGood knowledge of software design fundamentals/principles (e.g. SOLID)Experience working within Agile teamsAbout us:We’re Mission Labs.

Tech Lead Software Engineer (Growth)A Unicorn company that have recently opened up a growth division are looking for the first engineer to join their London based team. It’s an opportunity to have an immediate and real impact on the future of their product. They have a self-autonomous environment where initiative is rewarded and you’re given a huge degree of independence. What’s the product?With over 180,000 customers (including Coca Cola, Hulu and Universal) and growing, the product is work operating system that allows any given client to shape workflows, their way. They can boost their team’s alignment, productivity and efficiency by customising any workflow. It allows you to centralise all work, processes, tools and files into one operating system. The RoleAs mentioned, you’ll be the first person in their London growth team (they already have one in Tel-Aviv).They’re looking for an engineer who can look beyond the code and see the bigger picture. The growth team works across teams and has the responsibility of seeing new opportunities to increase users and subscriptions. As such, they want someone who’s happy to really plug themselves into both user and business needs. Because of this there’ll be the opportunity for you to write a lot of new code, increase product APIs and begin to implement some of the opportunities that you see.Longer term they are looking to expand the team; when you’ll have much more input into mentoring and helping to train up more junior members of the team.What experience do I need?They’re looking for an engineer who comes with experience of closing a whole product cycle, from a product based company. Primarily you’ll be working with JavaScript (Node, React) and Ruby, with a tilt towards the frontend (roughly 70/30). However, they know that a good developer can pick up a new language quickly, so they’re really not fussed on your background.Their software engineering stack looks like this: Ruby, Node, AWS, Linux, Elasticsearch, Cassandra, Kubernetes, Docker, Kafka. What’s in it for you?Based near Tottenham Court Road Station (right by the Meta offices), they’re offering a salary of up to £130K. On top of that is a pretty impressive annual bonus of 8-10%, as well as stock options. There are 25 days holiday plus your bank holidays. They are looking for people to come into the office 3 days a week at the moment, though the manager is looking to reduce this over time.The Interview ProcessIt’s a simple one. First stage is a short intro call with the Internal Recruiter, who’ll give you a bit more info on the product and project as well as take any questions you have around them. There’ll be some light technical questions but nothing heavy. This is followed by two separate technical interviews; one around the day to day activities they do and another that is more general. The final stage is an opportunity for you to meet people face to face in their Central London office and is a chance for you to get to know your new potential team.

        Hey there stranger 👋 You can continue to read or listen to Paige tell you a summary here :) ( https://share.synthesia.io/6addca22-31d5-4a3f-8738-4be5c8933a88 )TL:DR🎬 We are making the future and changing everything we think we know about video production📌 The role is remote in Europe or US Eastern Time, or on-site from our offices (London, Copenhagen, Munich, Amsterdam, New York)⚒ Stack: Python (Flask), TypeScript, React, Redux, Node.js👩‍💻 We need senior software engineers that would help us optimise and scale our online video editor.💶 from 100k € gross yearly + stock options (full-time employment only, no contractors)🦄 We just closed a 90 million € Series C round with Accel and NVIDIA, and 70% of our clients are B2B, including a lot of Fortune 500 enterprises. We have a very high NPS of 71 and customer reviews of 4.8/5 on G2.⬇ Below, you find much more info and the apply button ✅Who Are WeOn a mission to make video easy for anyone …Synthesia is the world’s #1 AI video generation platform. Well, it’s actually a video production studio — in a browser. As in, no cameras or film crews at all. You simply choose an avatar, enter your script in one of 60 languages, and your video is ready in minutes. In Synthesia, you can build personalised on-the-fly videos, give your chatbot a human face or run 24/7 weather channels in different languages, to name just a few of the possibilities. 🎬We believe the future of media is synthetic, and we are on a mission to turn cameras into code and make everyone a creator. Not sure what we’re talking about? Check out our brand video that explains what we’re doing at Synthesia in a way that even our grandparents * kind of * understand what this AI video stuff is all about.About The PositionWe're looking for performance engineers to join our team and revolutionize browser-based video production. As a performance engineer, your focus will be on optimizing our application to deliver seamless and fast video production experiences. You'll play a crucial role in enhancing performance, ensuring smooth rendering, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the browser.RequirementsYou ideally have a minimum of 5+ years of experience working in software development (in any high level language)You are an expert user of React and ReduxYou really know your browsers You have experience working on SaaS applicationsYou have the experience that ranges from early-stage start-ups to bigger, well-established organizationsYou can work cross-stackYou like to take ownership of features and execute from planning to productionYou are very pragmatic in your approach and you don't over-engineerYou have strong CS fundamentalsYou are very good at profiling and debugging performance issuesA good level of spoken and written English is requiredHow we workWe have a fast yet non-hacky development style. We work strictly with product managers who have a technical background. As a result, we do not overwhelm engineers with unrealistic expectations/requirements, and we can therefore move forward much faster. Well, we don’t have unrealistic expectations/requirements in the first place, since we see our roadmap as a set of high-level goals and we have no fixed timelines on deploying features - we want to get things to production as fast as possible. We do that by pushing features behind a feature flag - so not all users see all features, but our production is always updated. This brings zero-downtime deployments, backward compatible features, and similar challenges since our users should never be impacted. Our engineers have one sync meeting per week, async text Slack dailies, we have no dedicated QA people, we work in super small & independent teams, we have no Jira and in our team, we only have engineers, no code monkeys.For us, it's simple: give people time to do deep work. And help specify features that are limited in scope while discouraging hacky workarounds.It's early for us and we don't know how right we are yet. But after two years of building our product team and core engineering principles, we can see that we are on the right track. Progress over perfection.Our stack & some contextWe Started To Work On Our Main Product - Synthesia STUDIO - Almost Two Years Ago With a Very Small Team Of Engineers (BE And FS). We Now Have a Functional Product, That We Develop, Push Forward And Improve Constantly. While We Know, We Have a Long Way To Go, To Bring Our Product To Where We Want It To Be, We Also Have To Be Mindful Of Our Existing Userbase, Which Is Also Really Involved With Us And Provides Great Feedback For Each Update And New Feature We Roll Out. We Have a Lot Of Custom Components And Multiple Layers Of Complexity, Our Product Is Constantly Changing But If We Try To Sum Up Our StackFrontend is TypeScript/HTML/CSS using React.js + Redux; Backend is a mix of Python, Flask, Node.js (for real-time cooperation), and C++ components (we have our own Chromium fork for headless video rendering) that are mostly containerized with Docker, and hosted on a number of AWS services (Lambda, Fargate, EC2, EKS) We have a dedicated DevOps Engineering team. The good stuff...💸 You will be compensated well (salary + stock options + bonus)📍 You will work in a remote-first environment with offices in 5 locations🏝 You get 25 days of annual leave + public holidays in the country where you are based🥳 You will join an established company culture with regular socials and company retreats🤩 You get 4 weeks paid sabbatical after 4 years at the company + $10,000!!🍼 You get a paid parental leave👉 You can participate in a generous referral scheme💻 You get a brand new computer of your choice (if that still counts as a benefit in 2022 🤔)🚀 You will have huge opportunities for your career growth

Well, it’s actually a video production studio — in a browser. As in, no cameras or film crews at all. You simply choose an avatar, enter your script in one of 60 languages, and your video is ready in minutes. In Synthesia, you can build personalised on-the-fly videos, give your chatbot a human face or run 24/7 weather channels in different languages, to name just a few of the possibilities. 🎬We believe the future of media is synthetic, and we are on a mission to turn cameras into code and make everyone a creator.

Furthermore, your core duties will be to enhance platform security and user privacy as well as user authentication through Cognito, and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Your expertise in API key management will be crucial in safeguarding our services and protecting sensitive data.RequirementsYou ideally have a minimum of 5+ years of experience working in software development (in any high level language)You have experience working on SaaS applications (authentication, onboarding, billing, user profiles, CMS etc.)You have the experience that ranges from early-stage start-ups to bigger, well-established organizationsYou can work cross-stackYou like to take ownership of features and execute from planning to productionYou are very pragmatic in your approach and you don't over-engineerYou have strong CS fundamentalsYou are very good at profiling and debugging performance issuesA good level of spoken and written English is requiredHow we workWe have a fast yet non-hacky development style. We work strictly with product managers who have a technical background. As a result, we do not overwhelm engineers with unrealistic expectations/requirements, and we can therefore move forward much faster. Well, we don’t have unrealistic expectations/requirements in the first place, since we see our roadmap as a set of high-level goals and we have no fixed timelines on deploying features - we want to get things to production as fast as possible. We do that by pushing features behind a feature flag - so not all users see all features, but our production is always updated. This brings zero-downtime deployments, backward compatible features, and similar challenges since our users should never be impacted. Our engineers have one sync meeting per week, async text Slack dailies, we have no dedicated QA people, we work in super small & independent teams, we have no Jira and in our team, we only have engineers, no code monkeys.For us, it's simple: give people time to do deep work. And help specify features that are limited in scope while discouraging hacky workarounds.It's early for us and we don't know how right we are yet. But after two years of building our product team and core engineering principles, we can see that we are on the right track. Progress over perfection.Our stack & some contextWe Started To Work On Our Main Product - Synthesia STUDIO - Almost Two Years Ago With a Very Small Team Of Engineers (BE And FS). We Now Have a Functional Product, That We Develop, Push Forward And Improve Constantly. While We Know, We Have a Long Way To Go, To Bring Our Product To Where We Want It To Be, We Also Have To Be Mindful Of Our Existing Userbase, Which Is Also Really Involved With Us And Provides Great Feedback For Each Update And New Feature We Roll Out. We Have a Lot Of Custom Components And Multiple Layers Of Complexity, Our Product Is Constantly Changing But If We Try To Sum Up Our StackFrontend is TypeScript/HTML/CSS using React.js + Redux; Backend is a mix of Python, Flask, Node.js (for real-time cooperation), and C++ components (we have our own Chromium fork for headless video rendering) that are mostly containerized with Docker, and hosted on a number of AWS services (Lambda, Fargate, EC2, EKS) We have a dedicated DevOps Engineering team.

Company DescriptionTechnology @ UWThe company’s products may be quite “non-digital” in nature, but its strategy is not. UW’s success is predicated on the success of its technology platform, which is largely cloud-native and distinctively modern – especially by the standards of most “utility providers” in the market. Built almost completely in-house using standard (though team-specific) agile development practices, its operational IT systems are based primarily on open-source solutions and state of the art tech. Internal software systems employ event-driven architectures more often than not, and are composed predominantly of distributed microservices written in Go and connected using asynchronous message passing. Event sourcing is the default choice for backend system design, with business events modelled using protobuf and shared via pub/sub systems (mainly Kafka). Frontend systems tend to be built using React (in either Typescript or modern Javascript), while synchronous APIs are exposed via GraphQL or, for high-performance, purely internal systems, GRPC. Aside from legacy systems that have yet to be replaced, virtually everything runs in Kubernetes clusters hosted both on-prem and in the cloud.How we see ourselves in Technology:We care about how we deliver and who we work with – work should be rewarding personally, and not just in terms of a pay checkWe enjoy working on interesting problems with smart people and know that if it was easy, it wouldn't be funWe deliver quickly by keeping processes light and enabling autonomyWe’ve never believed in ivory tower leadership; managers should be hands-on and roll up their sleeves when needed to mentor and supportWe encourage experimentation, don’t appreciate egos, and believe in (friendly) debate, collaboration and learningWe operate what we build – which means reliability is key and devops is part of every engineer’s job descriptionWith 300+ people in Tech, as a team we’re very much backend-heavy in terms of engineering fire power; but with UX, Product and Data now growing quickly we’re in the right place to push on and hire people who will take ownership of how we define and deliver best-in-class experiences to our customersEngineering at UW:Our philosophy revolves around getting things done. We deliver with small, fully autonomous teams that have real ownership of their products using a cutting edge stack in a best-idea-wins meritocracy. We use the best tool for the job. Go and React are our bread and butter but nothing is stopping you from reaching for something else if it does it better. We deploy to Kubernetes across AWS and GCP with some help from Terraform. We run a mature event sourced microservice architecture using Kafka, NATS and GRPC.As much as is possible we code in the open on GitHub. If it can be open- sourced, it shall. If we can submit a PR instead of building our own, we will. Getting your hands dirty from the top to the bottom of the stack isn’t a promise to be broken, it’s a requirement. If you’re only good at parts of it that’s okay, we’ll quickly make you good at all of it.Job DescriptionAbout the RoleThe Staff Software Engineer reports directly to the Head of Engineering for the group and plays a key role in guiding software development and driving technical strategy across five engineering teams.Expectations of the role include:Taking an active part in the evolution of our approach to event sourcing by developing shared libraries, establishing best practices, and improving our event storage system.
